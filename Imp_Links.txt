Ram Disk:
         The problem is that the maximum size of a ramdisk, more specifically of size of memory that can be accessed via the ramdisk driver is configured at compiletime, can be overwritten at boottime, but remains fixed once the kernel is loaded into memory. The default value is probably measured in Megabytes. If I recall correctly the memory for a ramdisk is reserved right when the driver is loaded, all ramdisks are the same size and there is are some 16 ramdisks by default. So not even you want a ramdisk size of 16G :-)

         As stated in the other answer, tmpfs is what you want to use. Further, you won't win a lot by having your entire OS in a ramdisk/tmpfs. Just copy your builddir to a tmpfs and do your compiling then. You may have to ensure that all temporary results are written to a location thats in the tmpfs as well.

container_of Macro
    syntax: container_of( pointer, container_type, container_field );
    This macro takes a pointer to a filed name container_field, within a structure of type container_type, and returns a pointer to the containing structure .
    simply this is a convenience macro that may be used to obtain a pointer to a structure from a pointer to some other structure contained with in it.

Copy form and to user

        It is not true, copy_to_user, copy_from_user can in fact refer to adresses which can trigger page fault in kernel mode. If the page fault could not be resolved because it is invalid, it is because the access is regulated via the copy_to_user and copy_from_user, the kernel is able to propagate EFAULT to the user.
        So copy_to_user and copy_from_user provide protection, first it provides protection ensuring the address is a valid user space address and handling the page fault in case of invalid pointer sending EFAULT to user rather than crashing the kernel.
